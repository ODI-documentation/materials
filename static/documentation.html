      ODI models formalises the edition of the work, the description of the cards - both as artefacts and narrative instances - and the semantic links and narrative relationships between the different cards in each story.
    </p>
    <h1>The edition</h1>
    <p>
      The first module of the model (M1) presents the description of the edition (<code>odi:Edition</code>) with the information relating to a literary edition: title (<code>odi:hasTitle</code> property and its string with its value), author (<code>odi:hasAuthor</code> property referring to the <code>odi:Person</code> class and the related string containing the name of the person in question), publication date (<code>odi:hasPublicationDate</code> property and the related date format value), publisher (<code>odi:hasPublisher</code>, <code>odi:Organisation</code> and the related string containing the name of the publishing house in question), place of publication (<code>odi:hasPlaceOfPublication</code>, <code>odi:Place</code> and the related string containing the name of the indicated place) and chapters (<code>odi:Chapter</code>, <code>odi:hasChapter</code>). The six titled stories (<code>odi:hasTitle</code>) are enclosed in six chapters (<code>odi:Chapter</code>, <code>odi:includes</code>, <code>odi:Story</code>) whose titles correspond to the titles of the stories present in each of them; in the case of the concluding chapter, <i>Tutte le altre storie</i>, there are six other untitled stories.

    <h1>Tarot cards as artefacts and narrative istances</h1>
    <p>
      The second module (M2) contains the description of the cards in relation to both their presence in the deck (<code>odi:DeckCard</code>) and their instance in the different stories (<code>odi:StoryCard</code>). M2 also contains the description of the story (<code>odi:Story</code>) and has properties defining the title (<code>odi:hasTitle</code>), the total number of cards (<code>odi:hasTotalNumberOfCards</code>) and the list of cards in the story (<code>odi:Story</code>, <code>odi:hasCard</code>, <code>odi:StoryCard</code>). The cards in the story are also represented through the following characteristics: the presence or absence of the nominal variant (<code>odi:hasVariantName</code>) and the iconography on the page (<code>odi:hasIconography</code>, <code>odi:Dimension</code>), position in the text (<code>odi:hasPositionInText</code>), what it represents (<code>odi:carriesRepresentation</code>) and, finally, its textual reference (<code>odi:Representation </code>, <code>odi:hasTextualReference</code> with the corresponding string).
      The definition and description of each card in the deck is, on the other hand, represented as follows: name (<code>odi:hasName</code>), nominal variant (<code>odi:hasVariantNameInTheText</code>), suit (<code>odi:hasSuit</code>, <code>odi:Suit</code> and the string containing the suit name of the card), type (<code>odi: hasTypology</code>, <code>odi:Typology</code> and the string containing the name of the card type), number (when the card is numeric, <code>odi:isNumber</code> and the string containing the number), storage location (<code>odi: hasCurrentLocation</code>, <code>odi:Place</code> and the string containing the name of the place), physical condition (<code>odi:hasCondition</code>, <code>odi:Condition</code> and the string containing the name of the condition of the card which may be present, absent or substituted), iconographic image of the card (<code>odi:hasImage</code> and the string containing the hypertextual reference to the image of the card in question), author (<code>odi:hasAuthor</code>, <code>odi:Person</code>  and the relevant string containing the name of the person) and an indication of the presence or absence of the latter in the text. Finally, in M2, there is the description of the deck (<code>odi:Deck</code>): deck type (<code>odi:hasTypology</code>, <code>odi:Typology</code> and the string containing the name of the deck type in question), name (<code>odi:hasName</code>), date (<code>odi: hasDate</code>), author (<code>odi:hasAuthor</code>, <code>odi:Person</code> and the string containing the name of the person), number of cards originally (<code>odi:hasOriginalNumberOfCards</code>) and, finally, current number of cards (<code>odi:hasCurrentNumberOfCards</code>).
    </p>

    <h1>Semantic links and narrative relationships between cards in the stories</h1>
    <p>
      Each representation carries a meaning (<code>odi:Meaning</code>) that briefly explains, through a few words, the semantic content of the card in question. The representation is then linked, through different and specific properties, to 5 classes: the first is for the places of the stories (<code>odiFinctionalPlace</code>); the second is for the characters (<code>odi:Character</code>); the third is for the events that occur during the stories (<code>odi: Event</code>); the fourth is for all those representations that relate to a symbol or allegory of something (<code>odi:Symbol</code>); the last is for inanimate objects, or rather all those representations that do not fall within either the class relating to characters or the class relating to symbols (<code>odi:InanimateObject</code>). 
      For the links between cards, two cards can have a semantic link to express an identity (<code>odi:sameAs</code>) or an evolution (<code>odi:changesIn</code>) of the same representation in the same story.
      For the relationships between each protagonist and its cards, all properties chosen to best express the narrative functions of the cards for the construction of the narrative have been included: some properties describe actions (e.g. <code>odi:isDefeatedBy</code> and <code>odi:isHelpedBy</code>); others are more descriptive (such as <code>odi:hasFamilyRelationWith</code> and <code>odi:hasAParticularConditionOf</code>); still others serve to set the narrative in motion (e.g. <code>odi:longsFor</code>). Important, then, are the properties referring to places (<code>odi:movingThrough</code> and <code>odi:arrivesAt</code>) and events, to describe both the objects involved (<code>odi:implies</code>) and the people carrying them out (<code>odi:carriedOutBy</code>). 
      In all stories, however, not all cards have a direct relation to the protagonist card. For this reason, a distinction has been made between "simple relationships", the direct ones, and "complex relationships" (<code>odi:hasComplexRelationWith</code>), the indirect ones: in particular, cards that have a direct relationship can either be specified (<code>odi:isSpecifiedBy</code>) or have a general relationship (<code>odi:isRelatedWith</code>) with the card that has an indirect relationship with the protagonist card. For example, in <i>Storia dell'alchimista che vendette l'anima</i> there is a moment when the protagonist (represented by the <i>Re di Coppe</i>) obtains from the devil (represented by <i>Il Diavolo</i>) a transformation of the whole city into gold. The moment of this transformation involves three cards, with which the protagonist does not have the same relationship: on the one hand, we have the triumph <i>La Ruota della Fortuna</i> which represents the event of the transformation of the city into gold in which the protagonist participates; on the other hand, the <i>Nove di Coppe</i> and the <i>Sei di Denari</i> serve to specify the event of the transformation.
